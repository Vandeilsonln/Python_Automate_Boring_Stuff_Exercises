# Python - "Automate the Boring Stuff With Python" - Exercises
 In this repo you can find the exercises proposed in the book "Automating The Boring Stuff With Python".
 Some of them have exactly the same code as in the book, whereas other have been slightly changed in an attempt to improve the code.
 
 # I will be creating a folder for each Chapter as I progress with the book
 There are some exercises whose code is the author's sugestion, and some proposed exercises which I tried to code on my own.
